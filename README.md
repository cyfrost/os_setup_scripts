# OS Setup Scripts & Helpers

Most of the scripts/helpers should be idempotent and not push you to broken installs unless you do woefully wrong or are horribly careless running shit.

**Disclaimer: these are yet another useless scripts that I use sometimes, they're not really meant to be used by anyone other than me.

### Ubuntus: `crapbuntuOrDebianSetup.sh`
This sets up some basic stuff for an ubuntu 16.04/+ system. assumes you have a gnome install, uncomment the section where virtualisation is enabled if your CPU has Intel VTd or AMD SVM/V.
